			"input": "Explain photosynthesis to me.",
			"output": "Certainly! Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms convert light energy into chemical energy. Please see the simplified overview below:\n\nLight Absorption: Chlorophyll in plant cells absorbs sunlight.\n\nWater Splitting: The absorbed energy splits water molecules (H₂O) into oxygen (O₂) and hydrogen ions.\n\nEnergy Conversion: The hydrogen ions help produce ATP and NADPH, molecules that store energy.\n\nCarbon Fixation: Using ATP and NADPH, plants convert carbon dioxide (CO₂) into glucose (C₆H₁₂O₆).\n\nThank you for asking! Would you like to know more about any step?"
